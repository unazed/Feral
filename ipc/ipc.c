//We **really** need fast IPC (around as fast as SeL4!!!) because framing manager is in userspace.
//To have any reasonable chance at out-competing other platforms for getting ports of video games to, we need to have **signifigant** performance improvements.
//We have to obsess over the little things. If it isn't 256% better, not worth the effort. 100% doesn't cut it.
