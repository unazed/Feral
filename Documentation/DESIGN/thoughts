Subject to change and all that. Making a mess here, need to clean up all the text documents and give them some concistency and all.


Main things to note and care about:
	Once we are in kernel-mode, we don't want to switch out of kernel mode unless it's the best thing for performance.
	Efficiency through functionality: Instead of adding a bunch of cases into the kernel, let user-space programs manage it, and make several system calls instead.
		(We want to avoid execution time in the kernel as much as we can.)
	Feral should have some sort of kernel-mode hypervisor which 'talks KVM', for paravirtualization. The cloud, like it or not, is probably the future for a lot of less-critical applications.
	GPU drivers, at the very least, better be VERY fast. We want games to perform at the very best they can.
		(We'd better wipe the floor with a certain hybrid kernel for game performance...)
	Driver dynamic loading isn't something to particularly care a lot about, but shouldn't be hamstringed.
