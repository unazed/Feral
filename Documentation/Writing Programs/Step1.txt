Waypoint's API is fairly simple.


The main file which will be used is <feral.h>, which can be included as #include <feral.h>

Before this include, if you add #define WAYPOINT_LEAN_AND_MEAN, you remove the GUI parts and other non-critical interfaces.


The most simple Waypoint program is to show a MessageBox to the screen. While the specific window manager might be different across different distributions of Waypoint, the same function will generally still work.


#include <feral.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
	MessageBox(NULL, L"Hello, world!", L"My first Waypoint program!", MB_OK);
	return 0;
}


Waypoint uses Unicode strings for messages which will be shown "externally" (meaning a user can see it).


In order, the arguments are:
	Owning "Frame", which is a frame which can be shown on the desktop which has 'parental ownership' over the MessageBox.
	String that the MessageBox displays. This is a Unicode string.
	Frame "title" or "caption", which is what the top bar of the MessageBox displays.
	Type of message box. The values can be binary OR'd together for more values. These are defined in feral.h

[TODO when userspace actually exists]
