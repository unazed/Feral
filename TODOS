Work on Multiboot 2 compliance.
Memory management, filesystems, everything.
Reference whatever's needed.

Ensure we have some sort of ELF64 loader for x86-64 so that Multiboot 1 can load the kernel (indirectly) just fine.
Maybe find some way to glue an ELF32 stub on the kernel???



Speed is still a priority, so it's easier to run... faster, and faster and faster. Got to go fast.


Priorities:
	- Booting with Multiboot 1 on real hardware (ZEN R7 1700X and Braswell N3700 CPUs, we're optimized for ZEN (overclocked @ 4.00Ghz) though (the most powerful hardware I got).)
	- Printing CPU information to screen and whatnot, holding for 30 seconds, then going into a kernel stop error, which correctly changes screen color to blue.
	- Creating simple filesystem support. Possibility port from Mach or FreeBSD, more likely to have ports from Haiku.
	- Write a brand new TCP/IP stack. Port what we can from FreeBSD and/or Haiku. Rewrite lots of stuff, since the kernel wants to be "client-server pseudo-distributed" over the network.
		- (what we mean is that when we run games, we chuck non-critical processes at other machines willing to do tasks for us, then just ask for results when game closes. Less multi-tasking.)
		- Maybe be the inverse of ^^, having a dedicated streaming server to run games light years better than anything else..?, and just chuck it over the network?
		- (Waypoint isn't designed with security as a high priority. Mark processes which really don't matter to be right or wrong to do that, unless you REALLY trust the other machine (ie, own it))
			- (That said, security is a far cry from a non-issue. Try to secure it as best we can without compromising performance. Less data sent == better.)
			- Chuck your calculator or notification services or other things OUT OUT OUT!!!
			- Possibly encrypt for security, if you're sharing with other people on LOCAL network. We don't share over internet. Too much performance penalty.
			- Intent is to eventually be able to have games 'take over a remote CPU' for slower logic when available, so not so important things can have more cores allocated and not waste local 
			  hardware. Game developers should assume remote hardware is awful, and that it's only use is 'extra cores to use if you want them'.) Useful for rendering small things without 
			  wasting CPU time on small little details. (SQUEEEEZE that performance out!!!)
				- This gives purpose to your old computers again! (Ivy Bridge or earlier!!!)
	- Implement multitasking, multithreading, etc. Memory management is next!
	- Create 'smss.pro' and 'waylogon.pro' and 'csrss.pro', which constitute "init for Feral kernels".
	- Write libc wrapper for doing C stuff without closely relying on the kernel, along with a shell (possibly port PowerShell and Mono if we feel lazy. Intent is a "modern DOS shell" though.)
	- Port over FreedomCore, portions of FreeBSD userspace, etc. etc. Complete POSIX compliance.
	- Complete the framing manager/system. Start writing "The Waypoint Shell", which has all design choices carefully considered based on Fitt's law. Mockup coming soon.
	- Write GPU drivers for Team Blue! (We only support Team Red initially because easier because documentation and hardware and sample source is plentiful)
	[yeah there's no real roadmap after this point, this constitiutes a "0.5 Alpha Aligator" release here, which gets refinement and becomes a 'final' release which should have a stable ABI everywhere.]

When Waypoint becomes "production grade", we have a couple of release modifiers to do:
	- Long Term Support (aimed at solid stability, backport security patchs and all that, etc.) Minimum of 10 years of support on it. 1.00 should be the first LTS.
	- Short Term Support (aimed at somewhere in between regular release and LTS, stability is still a priority but you should get off this reasonably fast.)
	- Regular release (Supported until the next release.)

	LTS kernel releases are more aimed at PCs dedicated to doing rendering and spitting the output back over the network (streaming), or for render farms using Waypoint for some reason.

___
Crazy ideas that actually kind of sound feasible, well, if we get around to it:

	- Create an interface to allow the kernel to interact with OpenCL code running on the GPU (and even call and get functions and stuff) to further accelerate the kernel to AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.
		- Advantage would be that we could dump something like process scheduling onto the GPU instead, which could go through an analyze all the waiting threads in parallel...
		- Problem is that now we're using the GPU, which could be used for rendering more graphical fun stuff and not scheduling programs.
			- (But we throw unneeded programs out into the network anyway, and so we can just bring the scheduler back to CPU land and it's OK...)


___

Random ideas that probably won't ever get consideration again:
	- Do we want to keep the name Waypoint? Consider others like:
		- "The Hunting Party" (it's a collection of non-*GPLed free software >>hunting<< for the best performance possible. Strange for an OS name though.)
			- If we want a EMCA-234 personality, we port the MIT-licensed(?) old version(s) of WINE over. Not the latest LGPLed stuff.
		- "Morpheus"/"MorpheOS" (It's just a dream that will never get off the ground anyway.)
		- "GoldOS" (after the color scheme we picked)
		- "Midnight" (we really like the color black for some reason. This might cause confusion with MidnightBSD though.)

		- If we do change the name, it's most likely to something like "Cynic" or something. That actually aligns pretty well, sounds good, and isn't inaccurate.
			- (Or some mutation of that, ie, "Synnec", but that starts to deviate away from 'awesome' like "Linux" is)
			- I think the first release's working name probably will be "The Hunting Party", until a better name can be thought up as a release codename (Adjective + Animal format).

			- Naming scheme has Kernel + Userspace/"OS name" + release codename (ie, version 1.00 LTS: "The Hunting Party") internally.
				- This appears as a CHAR8 pointer with 64 characters (unused is just spaces), "Feral Waypoint version 1.00 'The Hunting Party' Long Term Support"
				- That string (and more stuff) shows up when you do uname or something. Whatever we can for jury-rigging POSIX compliance.
				- If you combine Feral with Toybox (or GNU), you'd get "Feral Toybox" and all. Not "Toybox/Feral" or "GNU/Feral" or especially "GNU+Feral".
					Please don't butcher the wonderful name that took too long to come up with by saying 'GNU/Feral' or something like that. Say 'Feral GNU' or 'Feral + GNU' instead.

	- Directly port FAT32 drivers from FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Haiku/whatever.
		(Is this legal though with the whole patent thing? What specifically is the patent on? AFAIK, it's on long filenames. Hence, strictly follow 8.3 filenames, or use NTFS for flash storage.)
			NTFS for removable flash storage is just... ugh...........

	- Write our own 3D graphics API, which ironically isn't really aimed at performance as it is to make it easy to create a new game/game engine against it. Fast enough for games, simple enough to 
		learn fast. The reason why we go after better performance is so well-crafted games can run faster. We're after desktop gaming, so, more games (on WAYPOINT) is a plus for us.

	- Be lazy and port Xorg instead of making our own framing system (new one specifically designed for performance). Probably not going to happen as better stuff exists.
		- (We have to have xorg compatibility though, otherwise we'd lose cheap and effortless Linux ports. We'd rather have bad than nothing.)




	- Give the "native personality" a real name, options off the top of my head are:
		- "OWaysys" (feels tacky to me)
		- "Way64" (feels trying too hard to literally be 'Waypoint Is Not New Technology!') 
		- "Waypoint API" (Gee, real creative.)
		- "Melancholy" (I actually like this for some reason... but it's too 'depressing' and/or 'edgy' to be used really.)
		- "Nihilist" (Probably the best out of all the others ones above. Implies there's no purpose to Waypoint programs though.)
		- "Catalyst" (THIS IS PERFECT... BUT... IT'S NOT INNOVATIVE. IT'S NOT CATALYZING ANYTHING.)
		- "Indecision" (oh the in-jokes.)
		- "Golden" (too optimisitic and cheery and all.)
		[Are we looking for a paradoxical word? Something that 'eminates cynical' but 'feels positive'?]
		- "Crusader" (Uh. Sure..?)
		- "Phoenix"  (Actually, this is kinda good.)
		- "Rebellion" (eh. Cheesy. Dumb.)
		- "Freedom" (Honestly probably going to go with this.)


	For ELF executables, we assume anything with the right ID in the ELF header to run under Waypoint natively. If it doesn't, we try, (in order and if available):
		- Linux personality (do the same thing FreeBSD does however that works)
		- BSD personality (if we ever write one)
		- Look for user-mode servers willing to take ELF for us, chuck it at that.
		- Check the section called '.subsystem' in it.
		- Give up and assume it's just a strange text file.



	Consider if we're getting into feature creep. Realize this is a hobby project and we have all the time in the world to actually get this working. Then ignore the feature creep. Aim for parity with 
	modern OSes.

Things that would be nice:
	- Make as much hardware available to application developers as possible. Doesn't matter if it's awful, remote, slow, or whatever, if it's useful, MAKE IT AVAILABLE.
	- Keep the kernel reasonably small (while being monolithic), lean, and >> FAST <<




We're not a REAL operating system (use Linux for gaming if you're serious about open source for gaming), just a little free software hobby project, but something that I'd like to have get off the ground and be a serious production OS, in the name of better game performance.
