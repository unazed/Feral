Some of this include our '/dev/random', which is actually A:/posix/root/dev/random, as well as our generic virtual GPU which utilizes (if glNEXT is not supported) the real GPU to run glNEXT code, or a CPU core to run glNEXT code very slowly.

We'd rather have very slow graphics than no graphics, and since we rely on glNEXT for pretty much everything (desktop compositing and whatnot)
